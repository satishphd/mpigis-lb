Test code for Spatial Aware MPI is present in testSpatialTypes.cpp

MPI-GIS has dependency on geos opensource library.
Need to specify the library path and include directory path for geos.

MPI commands (on my Mac machine with OpenMPI):
$ mpicxx -o test testSpatialTypes.cpp SpatialMPI.a -I/usr/local/Cellar/geos/3.5.0/include -L/usr/local/Cellar/geos/3.5.0/lib -lgeos
$ mpirun -np 2 ./test
