MPI-GIS software
MPI-GIS uses MPI to distribute the geospatial intersection computation among MPI processes running on 
multiple compute nodes in a cluster for geospatial join and overlay on a cluster of compute nodes.

This code is based on the following two papers:

1) Satish Puri, Anmol Paudel, Sushil K. Prasad:
MPI-Vector-IO: Parallel I/O and Partitioning for Geospatial Vector Data. ICPP 2018: 13:1-13:11

2) Satish Puri, Sushil K. Prasad:
A Parallel Algorithm for Clipping Polygons with Improved Bounds and a Distributed Overlay Processing System Using MPI. CCGRID 2015: 576-585
